  bnd inspect bundle.json

Extract the in-toto attestation from the bundle:

  bnd extract attestation bundle.json

Extract the predicate data from the bundle:

  bnd extract predicate bundle.json

  commit      attest git commits
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  extract     extract data from sigstore bundles

  statement   binds an in-toto attestation in a signed bundle
  unpack      unpacks attestations bundled in a jsonl file

## Native Sigstore Signing

`bnd` implements sigstore keyless signing just as cosign does. It supports the
interactive and device flows as well as limited initial support for ambient
credentials (initaially GitHub actions tokens).
